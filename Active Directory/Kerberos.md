Introduction:

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a widely used protocol for accessing and managing directory information. When integrated with Active Directory (AD), LDAP serves as the primary means of querying and modifying objects within AD. In this note, we will explore how LDAP works with Active Directory.

LDAP uses port 389, and LDAP over SSL (LDAPS) communicates over port 636.

LDAP Overview:

- LDAP is a protocol used to access and interact with directory services, which store and organize information in a hierarchical structure.
- It operates over TCP/IP and uses a client-server model, where the client sends requests, and the server responds with the requested data.

LDAP and AD Integration:

Active Directory is LDAP-compliant, allowing clients to communicate with it using LDAP queries to retrieve, add, modify, or delete information about directory objects.

LDAP Distinguished Names (DNs) in AD:

- In AD, each object is uniquely identified by its Distinguished Name (DN), which represents its location within the directory tree.
- The DN includes the object's Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) and the path from the root of the directory to the object.

LDAP Queries in AD:

- LDAP queries are used to search for specific information within Active Directory.
- Clients construct LDAP query strings based on their requirements and send them to the AD server.

AD LDAP Authentication:

- Simple Authentication:

- Includes anonymous, unauthenticated, and username/password authentication.
- Users provide a username and password in a BIND request to authenticate with the LDAP server.
- This method is straightforward but may transmit passwords in cleartext, posing a security risk.

- SASL Authentication:

- SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) utilizes other authentication services like Kerberos for binding to the LDAP server.
- Instead of transmitting credentials directly, SASL sends authentication requests to the authorization service (e.g., Kerberos) using the LDAP protocol.
- The authorization service responds with challenge/response messages, determining successful or unsuccessful authentication.
- SASL enhances security by separating authentication methods from application protocols.

Note : LDAP authentication messages are transmitted in cleartext by default, making them susceptible to interception on the internal network. To enhance security, it is recommended to use TLS encryption or similar methods to protect this information during transit.

LDAP Filter Syntax:

- LDAP queries use filter expressions to specify search criteria.
- For example, (objectClass=user) is an LDAP filter that retrieves all user objects from Active Directory.

Common LDAP Operations in Active Directory:

- Bind: The process of authenticating the client to the LDAP server.
- Search: The process of querying AD for specific information using LDAP filters.
- Add: The process of creating new objects in the AD directory.
- Modify: The process of updating existing attributes of objects in the directory.
- Delete: The process of removing objects from the directory.

Secure LDAP (LDAPS) in Active Directory:

- LDAPS is a secure version of LDAP that uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data during communication.
- Active Directory supports LDAPS, ensuring secure transmission of sensitive information.

Conclusion:

LDAP is a powerful protocol that allows clients to interact with directory services like Active Directory efficiently. By understanding LDAP's basic principles and its integration with Active Directory, administrators and developers can effectively manage and query directory information, providing a robust and secure directory service for Windows-based networks.
